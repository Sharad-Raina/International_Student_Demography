# International_Student_Demography


Our project is all about examining the trends surrounding the arrival of international students in the United States every year. I used data from four different datasets to dig into various aspects like where the students come from, what they study, how they pay for school, and their visa statuses. My main goal was to really understand the international student scene in the U.S., like where they go and what they prefer to study. By finding these patterns, I wanted to give helpful insights to guide decisions about international education and its effects on job opportunities in the U.S. These findings could also help policymakers worldwide shape strategies for students going abroad for advanced degrees.

As for my methodology, I began by gathering data from these four sources, each giving different insights into international student enrollment. Then, I merged and cleaned up the datasets to make sure everything was accurate. I used techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA) to dig into the data and find trends and patterns, giving me a good look at what international student populations are like. Plus, I used visualization tools like ggplot2 to help me understand the data better and share my findings clearly.

These insights are valuable for policymakers and governments to consider when making important decisions about international student education and employment policies. Additionally, sharing this information can foster cultural connections between nations.
